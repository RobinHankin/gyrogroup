Description:   The dynamics of three velocities in special relativity is not straightforward: the parallelogram addition law does not apply because velocity addtion is neither commutative nor associative: there is no group structure.  But velocity addition is an algebraic strucure known as a gyrogroup and this package furnishes some functionality to work with gyrogroups.
