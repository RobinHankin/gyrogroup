Description: Addition of velocities in special relativity is not
 straightforward: the parallelogram addition law does not apply because
 velocity addition is neither commutative nor associative.  This
 package furnishes some functionality to work with Lorentz transforms
 and the gyrogroup structure of three-velocities.  For general
 relativity, see the schwarzschild package.
