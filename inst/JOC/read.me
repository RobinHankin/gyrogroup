Draft paper for JOC.  To latex lorentz_JOC.tex, you need to copy a few
files (which are not under version control):

* informs3.cls, informs2014.bst, style files extracted from JOC-template.zip

* lorentz-assfail_fig.pdf, lorentz-comfail1_fig.pdf,
  lorentz-comfail2_fig.pdf, figures from the vignettes directory



Cut-and-pate the following to the command line to copy the files:


cp ~/JOC/informs3.cls .
cp ~/JOC/informs2014.bst .
cp ~/rstudio/lorentz/vignettes/*fig.pdf .
